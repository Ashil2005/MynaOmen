## Basic Details

### Team Name: ASHIL'S TEAM

### Team Members

### Project Description
A cursed bird simulator that randomly blesses or curses your system based on the number of Mynas that fly in. Inspired by the superstitious rhyme, "One for sorrow, two for joy."

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People go through their entire day without mysterious birds disturbing their workflow. Life is... too peaceful.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
MynaOmen interrupts your calm existence with flying mynas, cursor drift, typing chaos, and audio jump-scares. Pure nonsense. 100% useless. 100% delightful.
